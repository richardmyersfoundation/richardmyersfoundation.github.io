      <h2 style="text-align: center;">About</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Richard Myers was an activist of the Lockport/Fairmont community for over 75 years. He retired from Caterpillar,
        Inc after 42 years of service where he served as the Machinist union steward for 19 years. In addition, Mr. Myers served
        as the elected President, Vice President and Board Member of the Fairmont School board District 89 for a span of 17 years.
        Mr. Myers worked diligently to support the young boys in the neighborhood who were without a father-figure and living in
        single parent homes; providing additional support to help navigate around the crime, drugs and unforeseen activities
        that distracted many from getting a solid education.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Myers commitment in holding clothing and food drives, a host of free haircuts for neighborhood young men
        and an after school, Books Before Ball tutoring services, were all exemplary. However,  his deep commitment with his
        own personal funds supporting various students with basic needs, fighting to make a difference is commendable. His
        heart ached over the conditions many of the students lived in and he fought alongside other community members to
        make changes in the life one student at a time.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Myers was an avid sports fan and coach dedicating his time with various student-athletes. To address the
        academic issues many faced, he helped develop an infrastructure that provided transportation from school to the RMF
        center.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Richard Myers Foundation Inc. (RMF) was established and named after my father.  His pillar of strength to
        his family, friends and community left a legacy in everyone he touched. Our aim is to continue his work to ensure
        every childâ€™s mental, physical, emotional and social awareness reaches a fullness that empowers them to live a
        purpose driven life without hinderances. We honor and celebrate him and will continue his mission.
